## What exactly is this script for?
This script is used to farm the pokemon Cacnea, a common pokemon in the popular mobile game called Pokemon Duel. It utilizes pixel detection methods through the macro tool and language of AutoHotKey to optimize and efficiently farm the quests in the game. Cacnea is found in Chateau de Rose #7. Cacnea is good once it has levelled up to clvl 10 which requires 300 Cacneas or approximately 600 wins of the quest. This simple script automates the quests allowing you to sit back, relax and farm all the Cacneas you want.
